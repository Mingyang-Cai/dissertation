Codes for the simulation results and the plot in the paper

There are three approaches we applied in our simulation: original polynomial combination (OPC), modified polynomial combination(MPC) 
and substantive model compatible fully conditional specification (SMC-FCS). Three sub- archives for different approaches. 

The code for plots in the paper are also showed.
